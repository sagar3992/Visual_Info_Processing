# **Visual Information Processing**

## This repository consists of different methods to process the data. Most of the methods are developed to get flexibility to pre-process the data before applying any deep learning methodologies to the image and have been used in the developed systems such as Autonomous car driving, Netflix and many more and can create a huge impact in the industry of Visual Information. This repository keeps on updating adding new functionalities which would be helpful for my personal projects and industry.
